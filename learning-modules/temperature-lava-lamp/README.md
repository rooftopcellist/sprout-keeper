# Temperature Lava Lamp

This was the first time we went off script and made up our own module. We used a thermometer to read the temperature in the room, then mapped temperature ranges to different colors and had an LED Light up with that color to indicate how warm or cold the room it.

* Blue - 30 degrees C or below
* Green - 30 degrees C to 35C
* Red - 35C and higher
